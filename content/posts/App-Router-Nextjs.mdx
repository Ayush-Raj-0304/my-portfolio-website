## 🚪 What is the App Router?

The **App Router** in Next.js 15 is a powerful and flexible way to define your application’s structure. Introduced as a major upgrade over the Pages Router, the App Router introduces concepts like nested layouts, server components, and loading/error states natively.

It lives under the `app/` directory and enables a more modular and scalable architecture.

```bash
my-app/
  └── app/
      ├── page.tsx         // Root page
      ├── layout.tsx       // Shared layout
      ├── loading.tsx      // Loading UI
      └── error.tsx        // Error boundary
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **File-system-based routing** (like before, but more powerful)
- **Nested layouts**: Build reusable UI shells
- **Server and Client components**: Out of the box
- **Streaming**: Native support for React 18 features
- **Data fetching** with caching, revalidation, and loading states

## 🧠 Layouts and Pages

Each folder can have its own `layout.tsx` file that wraps all nested routes, making it easy to share headers, footers, sidebars, etc.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Navbar />
        {children}
        <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Pages are rendered via `page.tsx` inside each route:

```tsx
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>;
}
```

## ⏳ Loading and Error States

You can handle route-based loading and error states without any custom logic.

```tsx
// app/about/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}

// app/about/error.tsx
export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <p>Oops! {error.message}</p>;
}
```

## 🔄 Data Fetching

App Router supports:

- `fetch()` with caching
- `revalidate` for ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- `generateMetadata()` for SEO

```tsx
// app/products/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata() {
  return { title: 'Products' };
}

export default async function ProductPage() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products', {
    next: { revalidate: 60 }
  });
  const products = await res.json();

  return <ProductList products={products} />;
}
```

## 🧩 Server & Client Components

Next.js 15 uses **React Server Components** by default. Use `"use client"` to opt into Client Components.

```tsx
// app/profile/page.tsx
"use client";

export default function Profile() {
  return <button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## 📂 Routing Examples

```bash
app/
  ├── dashboard/
  │   ├── layout.tsx      // Dashboard shell
  │   ├── page.tsx        // Dashboard home
  │   └── analytics/
  │       └── page.tsx    // /dashboard/analytics
```

- `/dashboard` → Dashboard page
- `/dashboard/analytics` → Nested route within dashboard layout

## 🚀 Migration Tips

Coming from Pages Router?

- Move files to `app/` directory
- Replace `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` with `layout.tsx`
- Use `<Link />` and `<Image />` like before
- Prefer Server Components for performance

## ✅ When to Use App Router

Use App Router when:

- You need advanced routing with nested layouts
- You want the latest React Server Component benefits
- You need built-in support for streaming, caching, and error handling

## 🧭 Conclusion

The **App Router** in Next.js 15 simplifies complex routing patterns and modernizes the framework’s core features. With layouts, streaming, and server components built in, it offers an unparalleled developer experience for building large-scale apps.

If you're starting a new Next.js project in 2025, the App Router is the way to go.
