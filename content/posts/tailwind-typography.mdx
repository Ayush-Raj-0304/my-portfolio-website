## 🖋️ What is Tailwind Typography?

The **Tailwind Typography plugin**, also known as `@tailwindcss/typography`, is a utility plugin designed to provide beautiful default styles for HTML generated from Markdown or rich text editors. It’s perfect for blogs, documentation, and long-form content where typographic excellence matters.

Unlike traditional utility classes, this plugin generates a **`prose`** class that applies a sensible set of typographic defaults for various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, and more.

## 🧠 Why Use It?

- 🧾 **Better Readability**: Optimized line height, font sizes, spacing, and indentation.
- 🪄 **Beautiful by Default**: Styled elements like blockquotes, code blocks, tables, and links.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Friendly**: Automatically adjusts based on your theme.
- 🔌 **Fully Customizable**: Extend or override styles with `theme.extend.typography` in your Tailwind config.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To use the plugin, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then add it to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```

---

## ✍️ How to Use

Just add the `prose` class to the element that wraps your content:

```jsx
<div className="prose">
  <h1>My Markdown Content</h1>
  <p>This text is beautifully styled by Tailwind Typography.</p>
</div>
```

You can also use size modifiers:

```html
<div className="prose prose-lg"> ... </div>
<div className="prose prose-sm"> ... </div>
```

Want dark mode support?

```html
<div className="prose dark:prose-invert"> ... </div>
```

## 🎨 Customizing the Styles

Tailwind Typography comes with smart defaults, but you can extend them in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            color: '#333',
            a: { color: '#4f46e5', '&:hover': { color: '#4338ca' } },
            strong: { color: '#111' },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

---

## 🧪 Example in MDX

```mdx
<div className="prose dark:prose-invert">
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Use Tailwind Typography to beautifully style long-form content in your blog or docs site.</p>
  <blockquote>Tailwind makes styling Markdown enjoyable again.</blockquote>
</div>
```
