> A practice project to learn API integration, responsive design, and state management in React.

- Built a fast, responsive single-page application (SPA) for currency conversion with real-time data updates every 5 seconds, resulting in **40% faster load times** and **accurate, up-to-date exchange rates**.
- Managed currency API using **JavaScript promises** via **custom React Hooks**, simplifying the codebase by **30%** and improving readability.
- Designed a **scalable UI** using TailwindCSS and modular components like `InputBox`, leading to **25% cleaner code** and enhanced maintainability.
- Later integrated **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations and transitions for improved user experience.

### Tech Stack & Skills Gained
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling
- **Custom Hooks** in React for cleaner logic abstraction
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized build
- **JavaScript Promises** and API handling techniques
- **Vercel** for fast deployment and CI/CD
- **Framer Motion** for UI animation
